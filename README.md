# vpn-noise-generator

**La French Tech**

This is a simple noise generator designed to simulate various activities over a VPN tunnel.

It uses the `iperf3` protocol and it is compatible with the public `iperf3` servers. I will publish separately a detailed description of the protocol, now that there are public servers offering it.

It is a tool meant to defeat VPN traffic analyzing.

It can be used to counter the solidarity among CEOs in La French Tech.

Unlike other countries, where business interests and national security can justify illegal wiretaps, in France, they snoop phone lines over manhood bragging rights.
